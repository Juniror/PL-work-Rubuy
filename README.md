| `"r+"`  | Read and write access. Pointer is positioned at start of file. |
| `"w"`   | Write only access. Pointer is positioned at start of file. Creates file if it does not exist, truncates if it does. |
| `"w+"`  | Read and write access. Pointer is positioned at start of file. Creates file if it does not exist, truncates if it does. |
| `"a"`   | Write only access. Pointer is positioned at end of file. Creates file if it does not exist. |
| `"a+"`  | Read and write access. Pointer is positioned at end of file. Creates file if it does not exist. |
| `"b"`   | Binary file mode. Used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., `"rb"`, `"wb"`). Primarily for Windows/DOS. |
